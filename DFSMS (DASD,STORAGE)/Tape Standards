Job Class Standards:

Production batch jobs must have the correct job class assigned, otherwise the job may be automatically cancelled.
The following is a list of the available JCL job classes and their criteria:

Batch Job Classes
Class A – Tapes allowed with 10 minute time limit
Class C – Maximum of 2 concurrent tape drives
Class F – Greater than 2 concurrent tape drives
Class G – Unlimited tape drives and data requires retention period
Class H – Tapes created for outside organizations
Class P – No tapes but a 10 minute time limit
Class T – No tapes for jobs running longer than 10 minutes
Class W – No tapes

If the CLASS parameter is omitted from the JOB card, a class will be generated for the job. The default class is defined for: zero tape usage,
less than one MB region size and no more than ten seconds of CPU time.

Batch jobs running in the Test environment can use the following job classes:
Class A – No tapes with a maximum of 1 hour
Class B – Maximum of 2 concurrent tape drives, for a one hour maximum
Class X – No tapes but a 10 minute time limit
