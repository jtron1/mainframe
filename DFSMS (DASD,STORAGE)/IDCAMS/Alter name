if you happen to get this error :

  DELETE (MATEDK.VSM.JUSTICE)  CLUSTER                         
IKJ56225I DATA SET MATEDK.VSM.JUSTICE ALREADY IN USE, TRY LATER
IKJ56225I DATA SET IS ALLOCATED TO ANOTHER JOB OR USER         
IDC0551I ** ENTRY MATEDK.VSM.JUSTICE NOT DELETED               


and you try to free up the job but can not and need to delete the cluster just alter the name


//STEP02   EXEC PGM=IDCAMS                             
//SYSIN    DD *                                        
  ALTER  MATEDK.VSM.JUSTICE NEWNAME(MATEDK.FIVE.SIX)   
/*                                                     
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*                                 
//SYSOUT   DD SYSOUT=*                                 
//AMSDUMP  DD SYSOUT=*                                 


then do delete it with the altername , the index and data will be deleted as well
