destination(displacement,length,BaseReg1), source(displacement,BaseReg2)"

MVC 1000(3,R14),2000(R15)

On the left side (the destination where you're moving the data to): 1000(3,R14)

1000 is the displacement from the address in R14. This is where you will start placing (or "pasting") your data.
3 is the number of bytes you're going to move. This length specifies how much data from the source will be copied to the destination.
R14 is the base register for the destination, providing the starting point to which the displacement 1000 is applied.
On the right side (the source from where you're copying the data): 2000(R15)

2000 is the displacement from the address in R15. This is where you will start copying the data from.
R15 is the base register for the source, providing the starting point to which the displacement 2000 is applied.
