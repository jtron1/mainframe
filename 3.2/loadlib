Data Set Name: You would not change this; it's already provided as Z37931.LOAD.LOADLIB.
Management class: If you have a specific management class you want to apply, enter it here; otherwise, you can leave it blank to use the system default.
Storage class: Enter SCSLOAD if that is the storage class you wish to use, as it pertains to the performance and handling of the data set.
Volume serial: Enter ZXPM01 if you want to allocate this data set to a specific volume; otherwise, leave it blank for the system to choose.
Device type: Generally, this is left blank to allow the system to select the appropriate device type.
Data class: Enter SLOAD if that is the data class that applies to your data set; otherwise, leave it blank to use the system default.
Space units: TRACK is already specified, which is what you want based on the previous conversation.
Average record unit: This is typically used with RECORDS space units and can be left blank for TRACK allocations.
Primary quantity: Enter 1 for one track as the primary space allocation.
Secondary quantity: Enter 1 for one track as the secondary space allocation.
Directory blocks: If this is a Partitioned Data Set (PDS) or a Library, you may need directory blocks. The number 8 is already there, which usually suffices for a moderate number of members.
Record format: U (undefined) is correct if you are creating a load library.
Record length: Leave at 0 for a load library with undefined record format.
Block size: Enter 4096 as the block size.
Data set name type: LIBRARY is already specified, indicating a PDS or PDSE (Partitioned Data Set Extended), which is typical for load libraries.
