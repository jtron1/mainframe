Management class: Leave this as blank or **None** if you don't want to assign a specific management class and want to use the default system management.
Storage class: Enter SCSPDS if you want to allocate this data set using this specific storage class.
Volume serial: Enter ZXPM02 to specify the volume where the dataset should reside.
Device type: Usually, this is determined by the system based on the volume serial, so you might leave this as blank.
Data class: Enter SPDS for the specific data class attributes for the dataset.
Organization: Enter PO to specify a Partitioned Organization, which is typical for a dataset that contains members, such as a PDS (Partitioned Data Set).
Record format: Enter FB for Fixed Block.
Record length: Enter 80 which is a common record length for datasets containing code or text that fits within an 80-character width.
Block size: Enter 32720 which should be a multiple of the record length and less than or equal to the maximum block size that can be handled by the device type (3390).
Primary quantity: Enter 1 to allocate 1 track as the primary space.
Secondary quantity: Enter 1 to allocate 1 track as the secondary space.
Maximum dir. blocks: Leave it as NOLIMIT or specify the maximum directory blocks if there's a limit you want to enforce.
Data set name type: LIBRARY indicates it's a PDS or PDSE. Ensure this is set correctly.
Data set encryption: Set to NO if you do not require dataset encryption.
Data set version: Usually this is managed by the system, set to 1 if creating a new dataset.
