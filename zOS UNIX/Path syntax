When coding the z/OS UNIX directory and name, there are several syntax rules that need to be adhered to:

Each directory and file name must be preceded by a slash (/)
There is a maximum length of 255 characters
They can contain symbolic parameters
Note that the system checks the length after any required symbolic substitution has taken place.


//SYSUT1   DD  PATH='/tmpp/pfainst.err'
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*

When referecing an existing z/OS UNIX file name and directory, if it contains anything other than uppercase characters, it must be enclosed in single quotes
