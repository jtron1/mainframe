RECORDING MODE IS F - means that teh fortmat of the records is fixed. If you were using variable length recorrds you would 
specify RECORDING MODE IS V. If you do not specify a recording mode, COBOL will assume mode F. This is not a problem as long as you are using a fixed
length records. If you are not, you will get a run time error. In any case its good documentation to specify the recording mode.

RECORDS CONTAINS 80 CHARCCTERS - specifices that the logical record length is 80 bytes. This is helpful for the next programmer as documentation

DATA RECORD IS EMPLOYEE-RECORD-IN - explicitly ties the file descriptor to a defined data structure. This entry can simply be a dummy structure
with teh correct record length. You do not have to use this structure when you actually reference the file. By default when you read or write
data to a file, the designated data record structure in teh FD is the one it will be read into. So if you choose to read into 
EMPLOYEE-RECORD-IN, you only need to code the following for the read statement:

READ EMPLOYEE-IN-FILE

However if you want the record read into a different data structure, you must include the INTO clause in your read statement. Suppose
in our program we actually want to read into a different structure named IN-EMPLOYEE-RECORD which we will define in working-storage. In that
case , our READ statement will need to be: 

READ EMPLOYEE-IN-FILE INTO IN-EMPLOYEE-RECORD
