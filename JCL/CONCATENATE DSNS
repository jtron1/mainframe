To treat two of more data sets as a single data set, you can concatencate them. Then, if the data sets are sequential input files, 
the OS will read the records in the concatendated data sets in the order in which they're concatenated. 

if you concatenate files, you code the DD statements for the first as usual. Then you code the DD statements for the additional files in the desired
order, but without ddnames. The program will read the records from the first file and when an end-of-file condition is detected. The OS 
will automatically switch to the next file in the concatentation.

If you concatenate partitioned data sets , the OS searches them for a specified member in the order in which theyre concatenated.
