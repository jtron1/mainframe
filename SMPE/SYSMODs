Installing SYSMODS
The primary purpose of SMP/E is installing SYSMODs.
There are three steps in installing a SYSMOD:

Sequence Command Overview

1 RECEIVE

allows you to take a SYSMOD that is outside
of SMP/E and stage it into the SMP/E
library domain, which begins to construct
the CSI entries that describe them. This
staging allows them to be queried for input
into later processes

2 APPLY

Sequence Command Overview
specifies which of the received SYSMODs are
to be selected for installation in the
target libraries. SMP/E also ensures that
all other required SYSMODs (prerequisites)
have been installed or are being installed
concurrently as well as in the proper sequence

3 ACCEPT

When a SYSMOD is installed into its target
library, and you have tested it, you then
accept the change through the ACCEPT
command. This step takes the selected
SYSMODs and installs them into the
associated distribution libraries
