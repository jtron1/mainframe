A VSAM data set can consist of one or more components, 
depending on the type of data set being created. For example, a key-sequenced (KS) data set contains a 
data component and an index component. The example at the top of this page shows some JCL code that specified 
a new KS VSAM data set. The screen below this uses ISPF option 3.4 to display what has been created.

With your VSAM data set name and disposition specified, you will look at some of the other attributes you may require.

To assign attributes to your VSAM data set, there are two easy methods available. The first is to use the LIKE parameter. 
As discussed in an earlier module, this parameter will take the attributes from an existing data set and apply them to the one being created.

THE && OR & CAHRACTERS INICATE A TEMPORARY DATA SET, WHILE NAME IS A 1 TO 8 CHARACTER NAME OF YOUR CHOICE.
IF YOU OMIT THE DSN PARAMETER, THEN THE SYSTEM WILL CREATE ITS OWN TEMPORARY NAME.

THE DISPOSITION INDICATES THAT IT IS A NEW DATA SET, AND IF THE STEP COMPLETES SUCESSFULLY, THE DATA SET WILL BE PASSED TO A SUBSQEUENT STEP

THE RECORG PARAMETER INDICATES THAT IT IS AN ENTRY-SEQUENCED VSAM DATA SET

THESE PARAMETERS INDICATE THAT THE AVERAGE RECORD LENGTH IS 100 BYTES, WHILE PRIMARY STORAGE FOR 50K RECORDS WILL BE ALLOCATED

TMP STORAGE CLASS CONTAINS ATTRIBUTES REGARDING STORAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEMPORYARY DATA SETS

RLS=

NRI - NO READ INTEGRITY , MEANS THAT THE APPLICATION ACCESSING THE VSAM DATA SET CAN READ ALL RECORDS, INCLUDING 
UNCOMMITED CHANGES MADE TO THE DATA SET BY ANOTHER APPLICATION. NO RECORD LOCK IS OBTAINED FOR THE RECORD ACCESSED.

CR - CONSISENT READ - MEANS THAT THE APPLICATION ACCESSING THE VSAM DATA SET WILL NOT READ UNCOMITTED CHANGES MADE TO A DATA SET BY ANOTHER 
APPLICATION, THIS VALUE ALSO ENSURES THAT VSAM OBTAINS A SHARE LOCK ON EACH RECORD THE APPLICATION READS

CRE - CONSISTENT READ EXPLICIT - THIS OPTION IS VALID FOR APPLICATIONS THAT SUPPORT COMMIT AND BACKOUT AND ENSURES THAT A SHARE LOCK
ON THE RECORD IS MAINAINED UNTIL END-OF-TRANSACATION
