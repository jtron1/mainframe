Attempting to read from or write to a dataset (file) that is not properly opened or is unavailable.
File access issues, such as permissions problems or attempting to access a dataset that does not exist.
End-of-file (EOF) conditions not handled correctly by the program, leading to an attempt to read beyond the available data.

Something is wrong with the files 

for example :
